"Freytag & Associates, LLC",Consultant ,San Rafael, CA,https://network.axial.net/company/jack-freytag,"Freytag & Associates was established in 2009 to provide engineering consulting services, most specifically in the fields of acoustics and vibration.  We typically partner with other industry experts in research, engineering and expert witness projects.  An outline of experience and services may be found: http://freytagllc.com/.Currently we are seeking funding for a patent-pending vibratory tool for cleaning rifle barrels.A November 2012 Congressional Research Service report found that, as of 2009, there were 110 million rifles in the U.S. and 34.4 million people shot at ranges the same year (more U.S. shooters than golfers). Today there are more rifles and shooters, and all rifles require barrel cleaning. Virtually all rifle barrel cleaning is currently done manually with a bore brush, patch and jag, and various cleaning solvents; alternatively, some also use a rope pulled through the barrel. The patent-pending vibratory tool affixes a cleaning rod with brush to a handheld (wand) vibrator so that the rifle barrel lands and grooves may be cleaned with axial vibratory motion, similar to that from an electric toothbrush. This facilitates faster, easier and more thorough cleaning than that from the conventional manual method, and without the use of harsh anti-fouling solvents that increase barrel wear. No similar device has been identified.The Vibratory Firearm Barrel Cleaning Tool may be AC-powered or cordless for use in the field. One future embodiment may move the entire cleaning rod or only the brush at the end of the rod, or it may also be used in conjunction with other patented devices to fully automate barrel cleaning by employing a mechanical system to simultaneously cycle the cleaning rod axially while supplying cleaning solvent to the brush through the hollow rod. Another embodiment uses an ultrasonic transducer for cleaning.Initially 5,000 tools may be manufactured at a unit cost of $40 each and sold for $80 each. The sale of the initial 5,000 tools would yield $400,000 for a net profit of $120,000. An assessment of the initial sales will be used to plan future production. The future potential market for this tool is extremely large. If the tool were purchased at $80 for one percent of the (year 2009) rifles, a $40 profit on each would result in a $44 million profit. Additionally foreign and military markets may be pursued, and advanced products such as a fully-automated cleaning system may be developed.The Vibratory Firearm Barrel Cleaning Tool venture offers these benefits:1) Low initial capital investment and large profit potential.2) No competition.3) Low manufacturing and marketing costs.4) Very large market potential5) Excellent market positioning    Show Less","Business Services:AdvertisingDistribution:Retail DistributorsFinancial Services:Diversified Financials; Investment Banking & Brokerage; Other Diversified Financial Services; Specialized FinanceIndustrials:Building Products; Capital Goods; Construction & EngineeringRetail:Specialty StoresShow Less",[],,"Headquarters HQ, San Rafael, CA 94903US","Jack FreytagPresident",https://network.axial.net/company/jack-freytag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weäó»re businesspeople who, since 1977, have enjoyed a track record of working alongside entrepreneurs to help companies reach their true potential. One of our most recent successes came from helping to take Udiäó»s Gluten Free Foods from $6 million in sales to more than $100 millionäóîin just two and a half years. Weäó»re extremely proud of that accomplishment. How Do We Operate? We pride ourselves on knowing how to effectively operate companies. We understand how to accelerate strengths and bridge gaps in an organization by utilizing a fairly simple, extremely hands-on process. Central to this processäóîand a key to our successäóîis our sense of urgency and our ability to make decisions quickly. We work daily with the leaders of the company to take the business to the next level by focusing on long-term value creation. Our philosophy runs counter to the buy-and-flip approach exercised by most firms. When Should We Start a Discussion? If youäó»ve built a successful companyäóîand have a strong customer following to go with itäóîthis could be a good time for us to open a dialogue. Many owners ask about our typical exit timing. The fact is, there is no äóìtypical.äóù We continue to add value until we and the owner agree the time is right for a sale. We have no fixed expectations. Our Strategy Our strategy is to build on the inherent strengths of a companyäó»s people, products and brand. We amplify these through investment, day-to-day operations and the pursuit of new opportunities. Our goal is to maximize a companyäó»s long-term value. We work to achieve this value through a disciplined yet unique sales and marketing management style. We understand that the best opportunities often require nontraditional thinking. Therefore, we search for opportunities in areas that fall outside the mainstream, and we attempt to discover value that others may overlook. Having no fixed ROI expectations or time horizons for exit contributes to the atypical manner in which we work. Weäó»re hands on, working alongside the owners of the businesses we invest inäóîranging from sole founders to family-run companies.

Principals include a fourth generation family member and a managing member of a lower middle market private equity firm located in midtown. The principals, among other experience, have completed over 30 acquisitions in U.S. based lower middle market companies. Portfolio companies have spanned the following industries: precision machining and manufacturing in the defense, homeland security, medical device, and transportation. Duck Pond Equity is seeking to build a portfolio of wholly owned investments in diverse industries.We seek mainly lower middle markets companies, focusing on an enterprise value under $25,000,000. Our goal is for our principals and close associates to become very intimate with an acquired target, ultimately running the business daily. This approach gives us a unique advantage by allowing us to focus on our portfolio companies for maximum benefit. This also lets us truly become involved with and gain knowledge from previous owners, working with them closely to ensure proper succession, quick transactions, and the comfort of knowing the businesses is in capable hands. We generally do not discriminate by industry and favor retirement and turnaround/distressed situations with broad customer reach and breadth. We are, however, very geographically focused, concentrating on companies with offices headquartered in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Southeast US regions. Once again, this is largely a factor of our desire to work closely with our acquired targets.Overall, we are flexible as to structure, and have the ability to reach a decision and close a transaction quickly. Being a family office allows us to be nimble, systematic, and detailed in our decision making process; not being tied to the bureaucratic red tape of larger firms.

Recapitalizations We provide the owners of family-owned, closely-held, over-leveraged, or under-capitalized businesses with liquidity while allowing them to retain significant ownership and day-to-day operational control. As in every transaction, we are committed to preserving each company's culture and legacy. Growth Equity Investments We make strategic equity investments in companies seeking to finance rapid growth. Equity capital is typically provided to expand operations, enhance sales marketing, invest in new products, or make strategic acquisitions.

Fernandez Holdings,Family Office ,Los Angeles, CA,http://fernandezholdings.com,"Fernandez Holdings is a long-term investment firm focused on adding healthy companies to its portfolio and investing in them for the future.  Fernandez Holdings companies begin as well-managed, middle-market businesses with revenues of $20 to $250 million, and then through a two-pronged approach of maintaining what has made them successful in the past and making incremental improvements for the future, the companies grow and increase in profitability.  For some companies, injecting capital for growth and aggressively targeting new markets makes sense.  For others, shoring up the business foundation and growing steadily year after year is the path that works best.  Fernandez Holdings recognizes the unique needs of each business in its portfolio and provides the resources to accomplish the specific strategies for each company.  Fernandez Holdings currently manages more than $400 million, and all investment capital is owned by Fernandez Holdings, generated by the portfolio companies, with no limited partners or time-constrained investment fund partnerships to influence decisions.  Kirk Fernandez, founder and CEO of Fernandez Holdings, laid the foundation for the firm through years of successfully managing and growing Solutionz Conferencing into one of the top companies in the audio visual industry.  Out of this success, Mr. Fernandez began expanding into other markets and industries.  With each new venture, regardless of the industry, the consistent application of the business principles that made Solutionz successful has produced the same positive results in each company in the Fernandez Holdings portfolio.  Today Fernandez Holdings continues this philosophy with each portfolio company.  While operating independently, each company focuses on these core business values, and Fernandez Holdings is actively adding businesses that share these values to its portfolio.  As a member of the Fernandez Holdings family of companies, businesses benefit from the financial strength of Fernandez Holdings and the ability to leverage the expertise of sibling companies to enhance profitability and deliver long-term, sustainable growth.     Show Less",[],"Add-On Acquisitions for Solutionz ConferencingTechnology$10.0M - $50.0M$500.0K - $5.0M","January 2016Fernandez Holdings acquired Sterling Environmental Corporation.IndustriesConstruction & Engineering, Construction Materials, Environmental & Facilities ServicesJune 2015Fernandez Holdings acquired RTS Solutionz, Inc..IndustriesCommunications Equipment, Integrated Telecommunication Services, Technology DistributorsJune 2014Fernandez Holdings acquired Coufal-Prater Equipment LLC.IndustriesAutomotive Retail, Construction & Farm Machinery & Heavy TrucksMay 2013Fernandez Holdings acquired Confidential Airline Cleaning Business.IndustriesAirlines, Airport Services, Diversified Support ServicesAugust 2012Fernandez Holdings acquired PARC Environmental.IndustriesConstruction & Engineering, Construction Materials, Environmental & Facilities ServicesOctober 2011Fernandez Holdings provided capital to Rock Square, Inc..IndustriesInternet Retail, Movies & Entertainment, Specialty StoresJune 2009Fernandez Holdings acquired eCivis, Inc..IndustriesApplication Software, Internet Software & Services, Systems SoftwareNovember 2007Fernandez Holdings provided capital to Green Source Automation, LLC.IndustriesConstruction & Engineering, Construction & Farm Machinery & Heavy Trucks, Electrical Components & Equipment, +2 moreJanuary 2007Fernandez Holdings acquired Spire Global, Inc..IndustriesCommunications Equipment, Integrated Telecommunication Services, Technology DistributorsJune 2005Fernandez Holdings provided capital to Keen Distribution, Inc..IndustriesApparel, Accessories & Luxury Goods, Household Products, Housewares & Specialties, +1 moreApril 2004Fernandez Holdings provided capital to Bringham LLC.IndustriesDiversified Real Estate ActivitiesMarch 2004Fernandez Holdings provided capital to Boon Inc..IndustriesApparel, Accessories & Luxury Goods, Household Products, Housewares & Specialties, +1 moreJanuary 2001Fernandez Holdings provided capital to Solutionz Conferencing, Inc..IndustriesCommunications Equipment, Integrated Telecommunication Services, Technology Distributors","Headquarters HQ901 Bringham Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90049US","Jeremy JohnsonVice President",https://network.axial.net/company/fernandez-holdings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noble Funding,Junior Capital Provider ,Boca Raton, FL,http://www.noblebusinessloans.com,"Noble Lending Group, a division of Noble Funding, provides no collateral business loans $25,000-$2 Million. Our loans are fully subordinated debt to senior secured lenders such as banks, asset based lenders, and factors. We do not charge any upfront fees or closing fees, so our clients receive their approved loan amount in full. We furnish loan offers within 24-48 hours of submission, and fund in 3-4 business days. Our working capital loans are generally re-paid within a year. However, our clients may re-borrow once their loan has been paid down to half. For example, on a $100,000 loan, once the loan has been paid down to $50,000, clients may re-borrow $50,000 over and over like a line of credit. This feature provides ongoing working capital to satisfy growth initiatives beyond what a senior lender can offer. Noble Funding arranges asset based lines of credit $1 million-$35 million leveraging clients A/R, inventory, M&E, commercial property, and intellectual property.

"Banyan Investment Partners, L.P.",Junior Capital Provider ,Miami, FL,http://www.banyaninvestors.com,"Banyan Mezzanine Fund, L.P.was founded in 2002 to provide mezzanine capital to smaller middle-market companies headquartered primarily in the Southeast. Mezzanine capital is used to supplement a company's debt capacity beyond banks' credit limitations and is a substantially cheaper and less dilutive alternative to equity financing. With over $400 million of committed capital from Fund I (2004) and Fund II (2007), we can provide financing of approximately $2 million to $8 million to companies which meet our investment criteria, generally structured in the form of subordinated debt with attached warrants (for the future purchase of common equity). Banyan can also arrange larger financings through its partners or affiliations with other firms. Such financings are typically used for growth expansion, acquisitions, recapitalizations and management buyouts. Banyan's focus is on companies with seasoned management teams, revenues greater than $5 million, profitable high margin operations and in growing industry segments. We will not invest in start-ups, turn-arounds, or in real estate development, oil and gas operations or direct lending businesses. We strive to contribute beyond the capital we provide to our clients, by entering into a close partnership arrangement with management teams coupling high integrity with a desire to build substantial enterprise value. We expect to be active following the financing, making available our extensive corporate finance, lending and strategic management advisory experience. Investment Objectives: Banyan expects to form a close working partnership with each portfolio company's management team with the ultimate goal of enhancing each company's enterprise value. Our belief is that our capital commitment combined with our financial and operational expertise will provide each of our portfolio companies with a significant competitive advantage. Investment Criteria: The Fund seeks investment candidates that have the following: Companies with revenues generally greater than $5 million Experienced management teams with meaningful ownership interests Historical and sustainable high margin cash flow, with minimal cyclicality Solid industry fundamentals with favorable prospects combined with a defensible market position Effective financial controls and information systems Private and public companies No real estate development, oil and gas exploration, direct lenders, start-ups or turn-around situations. The Fund will primarily pursue investment opportunities in the Southeastern United States, with particular emphasis placed on Florida, although we will also invest in opportunities outside the Southeast.

BCMS Corporate,M&A Advisory Firm ,New York, NY,http://www.bcmscorp.com,"BCMS Corporate specializes in sell-side advisory services for middle market business owners. Entrepreneurs spend years building a business. Ultimately, they reach a point when it's time to sell. Most at this point face the largest economic event of their lifetime. Future plans and goals hang in the balance. At BCMS, we understand the time and effort owners put into building their businesses. Our focus is on achieving deals that recognize the true value of the business. The inspiration for BCMS was laid over 20 years ago when founders Brian, Dave and Stephen Rebbettes sold their first company, Contract Leads. Since that time, BCMS Corporate has grown to over 200 employees across three continents. Our Philosophy: Conceptualizing value when selling a business The most crucial advice we give our clients when selling a business is to distinguish between value and price. Many clients are eager for us to appraise their business. They believe that an appraisal of a business will indicate the price that a buyer would be willing to pay. Yet, traditional business appraisals are calculated using return on investment metrics ‰ÛÒ they calculate price based on standard industry multiples of historic profit. While this approach may be appropriate for a bank evaluating a loan proposal or for a company in severe decline, it will likely discount the true market value of your company based upon its future potential in the hands of a purchaser. What distinguishes price from value? Could there be more? Consider the additional value found in your client lists, skilled workforce, reputation, and other intangibles that aren't expressed in numbers. How could a buyer with better resources take your company to the next level?

Our strategy is to buy great businesses in our target industries and build value through both internal growth and acquisitions, resulting in excellent returns for our investors. The team at Oroco has completed over 50 deals totaling over $5.0B. We developed a unique capital structure and have capital commitments from family offices, wealthy individuals and small institutions. In addition, Oroco has formed a strategic alliance with a private investment firm that allows Oroco to partner on investments that vary in size and type. Our strategy is to buy great businesses in our target industries and build value through both internal growth and acquisitions, resulting in excellent returns for our investors. We differentiate ourselves from other private equity firms by our industry specialization, track record, operational investment focus, proprietary deal flow, repeat management teams and the experience of our General Partners. We use debt capital to enhance but not drive our investment returns. We are focused on long-term equity value creation through growth of cash flow instead of financial engineering. This approach ensures that our companies have ample financial and operating flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and, thereby, sustainable equity value creation. It means relentless attention to detail and execution against plan. We also believe in making sure that we and our portfolio company management teams keep sight of our long-term objectives and value creation strategies and objections.

There are three things that distinguish the Company from other private equity firms: Many of the partners are former operating managers and executives. We view opportunities as operators do, not as financial engineers We have offices in both the U.S. and Europe and conduct business in the English, German, and French-speaking countries on either side of the Atlantic. We are self-funded. We have never needed to use outside sources of equity capital. The A&Co. partners fund the equity portion of our transactions. This gives us great flexibility in our investment style. We look for opportunities to provide equity growth capital or to acquire independent or family-owned companies and corporate divisions or subsidiaries. We will consider unusual situations as well as strong-performing companies. We have the resources to initiate, close, and integrate acquisitions, and we have experience with both private and public financings. We operate quickly and discreetly.

Foundation Investment Partners,Private Equity Firm ,Chagrin Falls, OH,http://www.foundationpartners.net/,"Foundation Investment Partners is a private equity firm focused on acquiring niche manufacturers, high value added distributors, outsourced business service providers, and niche software developers. Our operating model focuses on partnering with the owners or operators of smaller businesses to provide the support, guidance and resources necessary to grow the business. Our Approach Smaller businesses face numerous challenges. Because of financial constraints, owners cannot always afford the luxury of having a specialist in every position. Each employee is asked to wear multiple hats and are often stretched thin juggling multiple responsibilities. It is not always possible to focus on where the business will be in five years because there are customer requests that must be completed today. Growth might be limited by a lack of capital or concern about taking on debt. Foundation brings the resources necessary to overcome these obstacles. We work with business owners to understand both their business and personal needs. Once we understand these needs, we build a conservative capital structure that provides owners with the cash that they desire while providing adequate capital to support management's growth objectives.    Show Less","Distribution:Air Freight & Logistics; Food Distributors; Health Care Distributors; Marine Shipping; Technology Distributors; Third Party Logistics (3PL); Trading Companies & DistributorsHealth Care:Health Care Distributors; Health Care Equipment; Health Care Services; Health Care Supplies; Health Care TechnologyIndustrials:Air Freight & Logistics; Airport Services; Building Products; Capital Goods; Construction & Engineering; Construction & Farm Machinery & Heavy Trucks; Electrical Components & Equipment; Heavy Electrical Equipment; Highways & Railtracks; Industrial Conglomerates; Industrial Machinery & Equipment; Marine Ports & Services; Marine Shipping; Railroads; Safety Equipment; Third Party Logistics (3PL); Trading Companies & Distributors; TransportationLife Sciences:Biotechnology; Life Sciences Tools & Services; PharmaceuticalsManufacturing:Building Products; Construction & Farm Machinery & Heavy Trucks; Construction Materials; Electronic Manufacturing Services; Forest Products; Health Care Equipment; Health Care Supplies; Heavy Electrical Equipment; Heavy Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery & Equipment; Light Manufacturing; Metal, Glass & Plastic Containers; Paper Packaging; Paper Products; Personal Products; Safety Equipment; TextilesMaterials:Aluminum Products; Chemicals; Commodity Chemicals; Construction Materials; Containers & Packaging; Diversified Chemicals; Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals; Forest Products; Gold Products; Industrial Gases; Metal Ore Mining; Metal, Glass & Plastic Containers; Metals & Mining; Nonmetallic Mineral Mining & Quarrying; Other Metal & Mineral Products; Paper & Forest Products; Paper Packaging; Paper Products; Specialty Chemicals; Steel ProductsReal Estate:Real Estate ServicesTechnology:Application Software; Communications Equipment; Computer Hardware; Computer Storage & Peripherals; Electrical Components & Equipment; Electronic Components; Electronic Equipment & Instruments; Electronic Manufacturing Services; Hardware; Health Care Technology; Internet Software & Services; Semiconductor Equipment; Semiconductors; Software; Systems Software; Technology DistributorsShow Less",[],"July 2014Foundation Investment Partners acquired WRWP, LLC.IndustriesElectrical Components & EquipmentDecember 2013Foundation Investment Partners acquired Acme Cosmetic Components, LLC.IndustriesAluminum Products, Gold Products, Metal, Glass & Plastic Containers, +3 moreJune 2011Foundation Investment Partners acquired Advanced Probing Systems, Inc..IndustriesElectrical Components & Equipment, Electronic Equipment & Instruments, Electronic Manufacturing Services, +5 more","Headquarters HQ1188 Bell Road, Suite 104Chagrin Falls, OH 44022US","David WoodFounderAmy ForsytheCara BrosiusAnalyst",https://network.axial.net/company/oaktree-capital-management-lp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alliance Business Lending LLC,Senior Lender ,Cincinnati, OH,http://www.alliancebusinesslending.com,"Alliance Business Lending (ABL) was founded by Jerry Kohlhepp, Steve Kieffner and John Cain. Messers Kohlhepp and Kieffner have over 65 years of asset-based lending experience. The recession and credit crisis in 2007-2009 dramatically changed the landscape for banks and business, especially small business. The debt market for small business has become very limited and without adequate credit business growth is restrained. The founder‰Ûªs envisioned this as an opportunity to both assist the banking community and small business, so they embarked upon the process of creating an independent commercial finance company to provide asset-based lending.The end result was the formation of Alliance Business Lending, LLC that is capitalized with a private equity placement and a substantial line of credit. ABL has an independent board comprised of seven managing members including the founders.ABL offers working capital lines of credit secured by accounts receivable and inventory. It provides state of the art collateral monitoring and loan administration services, and is only focused on the small business market within Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. ABL is poised and driven to be the lender of preference in this market.    Show Less","Business Services:Airport Services; Commercial Printing; Data Processing & Outsourced Services; Diversified Support Services;

Allos Ventures,Venture Capital ,Cincinnati, OH,http://www.allosventures.com/,"The problemIn Indiana, Ohio, and the surrounding region, there is a significant gap between the number of early-stage companies seeking venture capital and the amount of venture capital targeting such investments. Angel investor (high net worth individuals) activity and state-based support for start-up companies have been accelerating ‰ÛÓ driving the creation of more businesses seeking venture capital. At the same time, several of the early-stage venture firms that historically served this region, particularly those investing outside of the life sciences, are no longer making new investments. Others have shifted to later-stage (i.e. already profitable) companies. And, firms based on the coasts are hesitant to invest in ""flyover"" land, or at the very least like to have a local lead. All of these trends have made it hard for entrepreneurs to continue the momentum started with the help of their friends, family members, and angel investors.Enter AllosWe formed Allos in early 2010 to help fill this gap. We only invest in early-stage companies, augmenting the capital provided by angel investors who have helped the companies reach a stage at which they are ready for their first institutional financing round. While Allos may be relatively new, we are leveraging the investment experience and business-building skills and resources developed over the past decade by our principals ‰ÛÓ Don Aquilano, John McIlwraith, and Dov Rosenberg ‰ÛÓ atGazelle TechVentures and Blue Chip Venture Company, through those firms' investments in over 100 companies. Additionally, many of our investors are successful technology company entrepreneurs, allowing us to tap into an even broader experience base of business-building expertise.Don and John have worked together in the venture capital business for a decade, and with Dov for over five years, and we all share a common view of the benefits of a ""hands-on"" approach to venture capital investing ‰ÛÓ benefits both to our partner companies and our investors. This vision drives everything we do ‰ÛÓ from the number of investments we'll make (a select group of about 12 companies in the current fund), to the geography we cover (places we can drive to in 4-5 hours), to theindustries we'll invest in (only things we know well).Things we strive to doLead your syndicate ‰ÛÓ too many venture firms like to wait for the round to come together, rather than commit to help you make it come together; we'll develop a mutually-agreeable term sheet with you and work to build the best investor syndicate for your companyStick to our knitting ‰ÛÓ just like we stress to our entrepreneur partners, we focus on what we know best: early-stage companies in industries where our investment professionals have operating and/or investing experienceBe responsive ‰ÛÓ including getting back to you within two days of an initial meeting with our decision and next stepsAdd value as a hands-on partner in growing your business ‰ÛÓ we're experienced early-stage investors who can contribute meaningfully to the success of your business in areas such as board and management recruiting, fundraising, and strategic and exit planningStay out of your way while you run your company ‰ÛÓ while we have operating backgrounds and will seek to add value where we can, we only back entrepreneurial teams we believe can build their businesses, and don't invest with the intention of replacing the teamCheck out our case studies for some specific examples of how we've worked with our partner companies in the past, and our recent news to see the great progress our current partner companies are making.Things we won't doPhone in to your board meetings (and listen only part of the time), or show up late, leave early, and play with our iPhones in between ‰ÛÓ we actually enjoy spending time helping our partner companies, and we'll do it in person (even between board meetings, if you invite us)Sit on dozens of company boards, and ask you to remind us at every board meeting what your company does ‰ÛÓ we are going to invest in a select group of companies, so we will have time to properly engage and learn about your businessMake you run a gauntlet through an inexperienced associate ‰ÛÓ a partner will will be engaged with you from the first phone call (plus, we don't have any associates)Treat a term sheet as a starting point for further negotiation ‰ÛÓ we don't deliver term sheets until the majority of our due diligence is complete, so while a subsequent find could stop us from ultimately investing, we don't use the due diligence process as leverage for better terms after locking you in early in the process    Show Less",[],[],,"Headquarters HQ312 Walnut St., Suite 1120Cincinnati, OH 45202USSatellite 11611 N.

General Catalyst Partners,Venture Capital ,Cambridge, MA,http://www.generalcatalyst.com/,"There's a simple premise behind the founding of General Catalyst (GC) in 2000: entrepreneurs are best served by those who've been in their shoes. In fact, all of GC's managing directors are accomplished entrepreneurs in their own right. We're familiar with the challenges you face. And we thrive on our ability to use our entrepreneurial experience to assist, guide, and nurture entrepreneurs on their journey. As a venture capital firm focusing on Early Stage and XIR/Growth investments, we're thrilled to encounter and delight in helping exceptional entrepreneurs and innovative companies bring a new product to market or transform an industry. But it's more than just writing a big check. We're tireless in our business-building and partnership development assistance. Are we right for each other? When it comes to our companies, we're attuned to bold, restless, clear-thinking entrepreneurs, who have the ability to hold optimism and reality in balance with one another. We favor large market opportunities and a capital-efficient approach to company-building. And we see no reason why we shouldn't have fun together. We at GC specialize in two broad stages of investment: Early Stage and XIR/Growth. We have ten managing partners and tend to be active participants with our portfolio companies, helping with team building, business development and strategy. We currently have approximately $3.0 billion of committed capital under management across seven funds. Our Early Stage practice focuses on investments of a particular kind: Hatch ‰ÛÒ incubating and funding ideas created through our partners and ecosystem of entrepreneurs Seed ‰ÛÒ funding an idea that is brought to us in its earliest, most fragile stage Series A ‰ÛÒ traditional early stage funding for companies that have proven an initial set of assumptions and attracted a core management team Our XIR/growth practice seeks out companies that would benefit from our management, business building and financial expertise. We focus on companies with greater than $10M in revenue, generally profitable in the $3M-30M EBITDA range, and exhibiting high growth. We're open to minority and majority recapitalizations for shareholder liquidity and management buy-outs, though we favor businesses with strong entrepreneurial leaders that expect to stay in place after we complete an investment.    Show Less",[],[],"October 2010General Catalyst Partners acquired Advanced Electron Beams, Inc..IndustriesOctober 2010General Catalyst Partners acquired

From that point we develop complex financial, technical and operational models for moving forward.Armed with this knowledge, we can help structure deals, recruit senior executives, establish partnerships, set up premises and working operations.We can arrange for financing directly through our own pool, or broker financing through a network of contacts inthe international financial marketplace.Opportunity and Wealth CreationIt is in our best interests to identify projects that hold potential for both opportunity and wealth creation. We can help business to think laterally - identifying opportunities for growth that may not have been plainly visible. In working with numerous companies, synergies become visible to us that would not be a visible in the marketplace.Our team reviews and recommends at every level of an enterprise. we are not strictly interested in brokering finance deals and walking away. In fact, most business failures are not the result of lack of finance, they are the result of the lack of business skills. Many times it is not money a company needs to grow and succeed. Some times they need:operational expertisemanagement resourcesmarketing skillsproject management skillsentrepreneurial visionsales supportlong term planning and strategyShift Ventures has the resources and contacts to build a plan from the ground up that includes access to both capital and human resources. We supply the necessary tools to create opportunities and generate wealth for our clients.Anglo CanadianOur Trans-Atlantic operation allows clients to take advantage of the similarities in approach and markets between the Britain and North America. Expansion across these territories can be a relatively simple way of gaining disproportionate benefits.Established businesses can offset existing overheads and tap a whole new market place by setting up Trans-Atlantic arrangements. We can smooth the process so that what might seem a relatively complex exercise is, in fact, a simple and highly successful development and typically less cost than expected. Well established processes can be readily transferred, costs can be spread and an existing offer can be made available to a whole, new population.Because of the commonality between the UK and Canada, commercial links between these two countries can, of course, be an important stepping stone for much larger markets. The UK provides excellent access to Europe and Canada can serve as a secure gateway to the US.    Show Less",[],[],,"Headquarters HQ9770 Rod Rd, Johns Creek, GA 30022US",Keith Brannan,https://network.axial.net/company/oaktree-capital-management-lp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
